# TimeTravel-PolicyGradientRL
This project improves model performance using policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning, incorporating counterfactual metrics as rewards. By simulating time-travel scenarios, it explores optimizing decision-making processes to enhance reward structures and boost model efficiency and convergence.
